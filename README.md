# End to End ml project
Project 1: End-to-End ML System for Fraud Detection (Highly Respected)
Why this is powerful

Fraud detection uses almost every ML concept you learned.

Skills showcased

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees & Ensembles

Anomaly Detection

Class imbalance handling

Model evaluation (precision/recall)

Real-world constraints

Problem statement

Detect fraudulent transactions using historical transaction data.

ML concepts used

Supervised learning → classification

Unsupervised learning → anomaly detection

Feature engineering

Threshold tuning

Cost-sensitive learning

💡 This project screams industry-ready ML engineer.












What “End-to-End” Means (Simple + Clear)

For each project you will:

1️⃣ Define the problem clearly
2️⃣ Collect + clean real data
3️⃣ Explore + visualize
4️⃣ Engineer features
5️⃣ Train multiple ML models
6️⃣ Evaluate with correct metrics
7️⃣ Deploy OR package the solution
8️⃣ Document clearly (GitHub, README, screenshots)

So yes — full pipeline, not just training code.
